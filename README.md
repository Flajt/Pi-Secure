# Pi-Secure
A python security system
Hi, i want to pragramm a securitysystem in python with a server(computer or rasberry) and some cameras...
Currently I`m working on the detection/recognition itself with the LBPH algorithm from opencv, but it doesn`t work correctly.
So if you now how to use it, it will be nice if you can inform me.

What is it:
This project should allow you to setup your own home securitysystem for less money.

What you will need:
You need a Raspberry Pi with Internet, Python 3, another computer and a Camera with cable.
