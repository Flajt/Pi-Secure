A python security system
Hi, i want to pragramm a securitysystem in python with a server(computer or rasberry) and some cameras...
Currently I`m working on the detection/recognition itself with the LBPH algorithm from opencv, but it doesn`t work correctly.
So if you now how to use it, it will be nice if you can inform me.
