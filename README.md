A python security system 
Hi, i want to pragramm a securitysystem in python with a server(computer or rasberry) and some cameras...
But i am new in Python so I need help.
The programm should "scan" the Faces from peoples with a camera (or more at diffrent places) that want to cross a
part of lets say a pice of ground and look in a "databank" or something like that were are diffrent pictures and is
the person how want to cross it in the databank the camrea takes a photo and send it to the lets say me per mail.
The programm should include a user inteface (to upload pictures and so on) but not a GUI.
I hope you understood what I mean.

I am working at the user login the next.
